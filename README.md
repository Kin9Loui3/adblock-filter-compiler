# fliterlists
Python-based script to generate AdBlock syntax filters by combining and processing multiple blocklists, host files, and domain lists. The script fetches and parses blocklists and whitelists from provided URLs, removes redundant entries, and creates two output files: blocklist.txt and whitelist.txt
